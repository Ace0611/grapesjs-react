_React wrapper for GrapesJS_

I am developing the next version for `grapesjs-react` with new features. These are the goals:
- JSX processor
- Type definition for `grapesjs` and `grapesjs-react`
- Transform `component`, `block`, `style`, `storage`, `preset`, `plugin` to very basic and easy-to-use concepts.

If you have your great ideas, please contributes by pull requests or feature requests!
